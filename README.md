Data Analytics Project
(Bank Loan)
Problem Statement:

In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by Loan Status. 
By providing insights into metrics such as 
Total Loan Applications
Total Funded Amount
Total Amount Received
Month-to-Date(MTD) Funded Amount  
MTD Amount Received
Average Interest Rate
AverageDebt-to-IncomeRatio(DTI)
This Analytics Report will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

Total Loan Applications:
We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2. Total Funded Amount:
Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

3. Total Amount Received:
Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to- Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.


4. Average Interest Rate:
Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

Good Loans:
Good Loan Application Percentage
Good Loan Applications
Good Loan Funded Amount
Good Loan Total Received Amount

Bad Loans:
Bad Loan Application Percentage 
Bad Loan Applications
Bad Loan Funded Amount
Bad Loan Total Received Amount

Chart's Requirement:
    1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):
	To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities

Regional Analysis by State :  To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities 

Loan Term Analysis :  To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths. 

Employee Length Analysis:  How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications. 

5. Loan Purpose Breakdown: 	Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

6. Home Ownership Analysis :
	For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
